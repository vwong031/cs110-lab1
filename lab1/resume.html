    <h2>&#128269; Subject Interests</h2>
    <p>Embedded Systems: I first developed an interest in embedded systems around 2022 when I took my first embedded systems course. I love combining hardware and software and being able to physically see my code come to life. That is the most rewarding part for me. I also have an interest in working with Arduino's and FPGA's and seeing how many cool things you can create with them. </p>
    <p>Operating Systems: I am interested in regular expressions and how it can be used to create languages. I took my first operating systems course in 2024 and while the labs were a lot of work, I thoroughly enjoyed figuring out how to create rules to fit the language I created.</p>
